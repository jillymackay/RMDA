# Preface  {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the Research Methods and Data Analysis course on the International Animal Welfare Ethics and Law MSc at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.

It is a companion document to the course, and not core to the materials.

Throughout the RMDA Lectures, you will see a number of statistical tests, data visualisations, data manipulation, text mining, and simple calculations. Almost inevitably, each one of these steps will have been performed in R.

Your R textbook is [R\@R(D)SVS](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/index.html "R@R(D)SVS Textbook"), and that textbook will explain h[ow to download and install R,](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/install.html "Installing R") [how to run simple commands in R](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/start.html), and more. This RMDA textbook is like an accompanying document to your lecture materials, and is a place to help you move your R and statistical knowledge along.
